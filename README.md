# QPO-Project
Code to solve initial value problem for the eigenmode solution to the shear wave equation in spherical coordinates. 

AL:
The Alfven Luminosity notebook imports the contour calculations and compiles them into an Alfven Luminosity and Escaped Energy plots.

AnalyzeSimulationData:
This notebook imports contour calculations for constructing time series and DFT plots.

ContourOriginDivergence:
This notebook contains the analysis of the Contour solution diverging near the origin, in addition to comparisons between numeric computation methods.

DisplacementVsFrequency:
This notebook is a streamlined version of ASD.nb but produces power spectra using peak widths and no time-series/DFTs.

InitialConditionMomentumEnergy:
This notebook sets and validates initial conditions and gives the IC shear energy.

Spherical Eigenvalues:
A notebook for consolidating eigenvalues, a WM package to calculate type-II modes and files of already-computed eigenvalues for various speed ratios.
